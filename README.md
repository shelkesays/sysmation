Its a version of each linux command in python


Do you know how many CPU(s) are there in your processor? or what is the model name? Let us write some code which can help us to know these things.

If you are in Linux, then you can actually view the output of the lscpu command first. You can actually find the information in a file located at /proc/cpuinfo.

Now try to write code which will open the file in read only mode and then read the file line by line and find out the number of CPU(s).

After you do this, try to write your own lscpu command in Python :)
